maven,org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-joda,org.openrewrite.java.joda.time.NoJodaTime,Prefer the Java standard library instead of Joda-Time,"Before Java 8, Java lacked a robust date and time library, leading to the widespread use of Joda-Time to fill this gap. With the release of Java 8, the `java.time` package was introduced, incorporating most of Joda-Time's concepts. Features deemed too specialized or bulky for `java.time` were included in the ThreeTen-Extra library.  This recipe migrates Joda-Time types to `java.time` and `threeten-extra` types.",5,Joda-Time,Joda,Java,Recipes for Joda-Time.,,Basic building blocks for transforming Java code.
